# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Workspace

This directory contains all Infrastructure as Code configurations for our environment.

## Structure

- `environments/` - Environment-specific configurations
  - `dev/` - Development environment
  - `test/` - Testing environment
  - `prod/` - Production environment
- `modules/` - Reusable infrastructure modules
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts for deployment and management
- `templates/` - Template files
- `config/` - Configuration files

## Getting Started

1. Choose the appropriate environment directory
2. Review and modify configuration files as needed
3. Use the deployment scripts in the `scripts/` directory to deploy

## Tools

This workspace supports multiple IaC tools:
- Bicep (Azure)
- Terraform
- ARM Templates
- CloudFormation

## Best Practices

- Use modules for reusable components
- Keep environment-specific configuration separate from shared resources
- Document all major infrastructure components
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include appropriate tagging for resources
